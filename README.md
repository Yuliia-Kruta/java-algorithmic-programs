<h2>Project description</h2>
This program written in Java finds and prints pairs of amicable numbers. It uses a combination of arithmetic operations and prime number checks to identify these pairs.
<h2>What are the amicable numbers?</h2>
Amicable numbers are two different numbers where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the other. Proper divisors of a number are all the positive divisors of the number excluding the number itself. <br/><br/>For example, the pair (220, 284) is an example of amicable numbers because:

The proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110. Their sum is 284.<br/>
The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142. Their sum is 220.
This mutual relationship defines them as amicable.
