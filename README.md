<h1 align="center">Basic Algorithms</h1>
<h2>Branch description</h2>
This branch contains Java programs that demonstrate fundamental algorithms and concepts. Each program is designed to help understand different algorithmic principles and solve common computational problems.
The programs included are:

1. **Collatz Conjecture**: Demonstrates the Collatz conjecture (3n+1) algorithm by iterating through a sequence until the number reaches 1. The program provides output at each step of the process.

2. **Euclidean Algorithm**: Implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two natural numbers using subtraction.

3. **Find Minimum and Maximum**: A program that finds and displays the smallest and largest integers from user input. The input process terminates when the user enters 0.

4. **Guess the Number**: A simple number guessing game where the computer selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. The program provides hints and counts the number of attempts.

5. **Palindrome Checker**: Checks if a given number is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward.

6. **Perfect Numbers**: Finds and displays perfect numbers below a specified limit. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).

7. **Pythagoras**: Uses the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, given the lengths of the other two sides.

8. **Recursive Fibonacci, Factorial, and Digit Count**: 
    - **Fibonacci Sequence**: Computes and displays the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
    - **Factorial**: Calculates the factorial of a given number.
    - **Number of Digits**: Counts the number of digits in a given integer.

9. **Series Calculation**: Computes and displays terms of a mathematical series given by Termâ‚– = x^(2k) / (2k)!, where k ranges from 1 to a user-specified number.

10. **Tower of Hanoi**: Solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle by providing instructions to move disks between pegs to achieve the goal configuration.
